When dealing with a custom pull to refresh view, often the native UIRefreshControl is not ideal as it is not customizable. A common customization besides the pull to refresh, is to have a circular progress view with the logo of the app to show during the dragging. This version of the pull to refresh allows to preserve the contentInset on the scrollview.'
